This is a Tic Tac Toe clone game implemented in C#, using Unity as the game engine.
This game is part of my personal challenge of creating one game a week (https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/game-a-week-getting-experienced-at-failure) in order to gain experience in game development and, of course, having the immense pleasure of finishing a personal project.
